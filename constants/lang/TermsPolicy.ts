export const PRIVACY_POLICY_TEXT = `
We built Dear Days as a safe, personal space for couples to store and relive their memories.
Your privacy matters to us, and we keep things simple:

Information we store
Only what you choose to add inside the app — notes, dates, photos, or profile details.
We do not collect hidden data or track you across other apps.

How we use your data
Everything stays inside your account and is used only to run the app’s features.
We never sell or share your personal information.

Storage & security
Your data is stored securely. If you uninstall the app or clear data, your memories will be deleted from your device (or our server, if cloud sync is added later).

Children’s privacy
Dear Days is meant for adults and couples. We don’t knowingly collect data from children under 13.

Changes
We may update this policy if new features are added. Any updates will appear right here.

If you have questions, write to us at sandhyajana7797@gmail.com
